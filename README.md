# BollingerBot
I recently wrote about a no-margin strategy using Bollinger band breaks to trade stocks. The algorithm was backtested using all of the S&P 500 tickers (where data was available) for 1-, 5-, and 10-year time periods. This repository contains the images (examples in the posts) and the lists of trades that would be executed if trading that strategy.
